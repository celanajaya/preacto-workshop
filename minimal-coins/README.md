# Minimal Coins

Write a program that given a set of coins and an amount of money will return the minimal number of coins to make change for that amount. Both will be of the same denomination.

For example, given coins of value 1,3,9,10 and an amount of 15, you should return 3.

Your function should have the following signature:
```
function minimalCoins(coinArray, amount) {
  //coinArray is an array of the types of coins you have available
  //amount is a number
  //should return true or false
}
```

# Running the tests

` testem`

Don't have `testem`? Install it globally with
